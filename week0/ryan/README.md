This project contains three programs:
  * **eratosthenes** is a program that identifies prime numbers
  * **schedules** simulates the first-come, first-served
    scheduling of random processes (tasks)
  * **treesort** sorts a set of integers by building a binary
    search tree and then traversing that tree

Build the programs by typing:
  * *make erastothenes* (to build erastothenes)
  * *make schedules* (to build schedules)
  * *make treesorts* (to build treesorts)
  * *make all* (to build all 3 programs)
  * *make clean* (to delete executable files)

Run the programs by typing:
  * *erastothenes*
  * *schedules*
  * *treesorts 34 19 89 55 60 26 88 24* (or supply any other set of integers)
